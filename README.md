Overview
---------
The Retro Tech Connection allows users to collect, share, and trade both their retro software and hardware collections. The site neatly categoriezes and organizes software and hardware as well as adding official descriptions and media (such as images). The site is innovative in its method of organization by user ownership allowing enthuiasts to easily compare and share their collections with others on one platform. The site acts as an interactive archive and organizational tool for users with collections they'd like to share with the world. </br>
