# Innovative Idea:
A Retro Tech Collection Organizing and Sharing website. Users would be able to share hardware and software in their retro tech collections. All items would include things like images, archive.org links, URLs to files (in the case of some software), and tags (for example an Apple II might have the tag: “Apple” for search purposes). This site would allow people to discover older technology and encourages the preservation of both older software and hardware, while connecting those passionate about it. This site also replaces the spreadsheet many enthusiasts maintain to keep track of their extensive collections. While we envision this as being a site dedicated to preservation and sharing of retro tech, the collection and sharing aspect of the site would be extensible to any community of collectors.

While our site is in some ways related to archive.org - it would be innovative in both its express purpose of perserving retro software (and hardware) and the organization of the site by induvidual users (and their respective collections).

# Data Interactions:
- Search function for both tags and users (tag ex: "Apple" user ex: "John Smith").
- Ability for users to view other's collection pages, read descriptions of each item in the collection, view images associated with each item, or follow links associated with those items.
- User addition of software/hardware to their personal collection. This data would include media such as images, links, and tags associated with a piece of software/hardware.
- Ability to "trade" collection items with other users.
