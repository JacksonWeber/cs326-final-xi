# Innovative Idea:
### University Glossary is a crowd-sourced glossary for common university terms, slang and acronyms. At UMass Amherst, for example, students and visitors alike often get tripped up on places like M5 and SEL, and may want unbiased clarification on terms like "Blarney" and "maroon soldier" (Parking Services employees writing tickets). We hope to create a catalog of these terms, with definitions, pictures, and Google Maps links (if applicable). New submissions or edits would be submitted by users for specific schools and approved by pre-assigned administrators familiar with the specific schools. As a stretch goal we may have a reputation system so that frequent submitters of reliable information could have their requests auto-approved.
