# Innovative Idea:
University Glossary is a crowd-sourced glossary for common university terms, slang and acronyms. At UMass Amherst, for example, students and visitors alike often get tripped up on places like M5 and SEL, and may want unbiased clarification on terms like "Blarney" and "maroon soldier" (Parking Services employees writing tickets). We hope to create a catalog of these terms, with definitions, pictures, and Google Maps links (if applicable). New submissions or edits would be submitted by users for specific schools and approved by pre-assigned administrators familiar with the specific schools. As a stretch goal we may have a reputation system so that frequent submitters of reliable information could have their requests auto-approved.

This idea is similar to how Urban Dictionary operates. However, Urban Dictionary focuses on broad knowledge (and adult humor), with an audience of young adults. University Glossary contains university-specific information with a target audience of university students and visitors. The content present on both sites should be mutually exclusive. Additionally, Urban Dictionary terms only support text and links to other terms, while University Glossary will contain photos and Google Maps links, at least.

# Important Components:
- Selection between different universities (separate data)
- Search function for different terms
- Submissions of new or updated term definitions
- Administrator page to approve submisisons
